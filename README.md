## 02nd APRIL 2022
[BACKEND PROJECT IDEA] : A platform where users can download SVGs and customize their own.
- Designed main website layout in figma.
- Decided to add a cool "hi" svg animation to the front page.
- Started downloading After Effects.
- Designed a first "Hi" template.
- Installed BodyMovin AE plugin to implement After Effect animations as SVG (as code and not video).
- Exported JS code for SVG player, implemented animation... It worked.

TASKS FOR NEXT TIME:
- [ ] Figure out how to make JS to somehow work with Flask.
- [ ] Design and complete a totally cool animation for the website.
- [ ] Figure out how the hell does tailwind CSS works and how can I code a navbar with it.
